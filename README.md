# Indian-General-Election-2019-Candidate-Winning-Predictability
With 600M+ voters voting for 8500+ candidates across 543 constituencies, the general elections in the world's largest democracy are a potential gold mine of data
The Dataset has many features and one label which is classified as 1 and 0,1 indicates that the candidate won,and 0 indicates that the candidate lost.
I have done a lot of data cleaning to categorize and remove anomalies,the code is written is python with sklearn libraries and used DecisionTreeClassifier and RandomForestClassifier and classification algorithms,to test the accuracy of both algorithms and choose the one which is better.
